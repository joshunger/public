> Design a key fob for a 16-year-old girl.

#### 1. Resolve Ambiguity
Who is buying the car—the girl or the parents? Is this for a new car or an additional key fob for an existing car? Is it a regular car or an SUV?
The first question is important because it determines who the customer is: just the girl, or the girl and the parents. The second question is important because it determines what the “first-time user” setup is: will it just work, or will it take programming? The third question determines whether or not the key fab needs a button to pop the trunk.

#### 2. What Are the Basic Product Needs?
A key fob must, at the minimum, be able to unlock the car, lock the car, activate the alarm, and pop the trunk.

#### 3. What Does the Customer Need? (And Who Is the Customer?)
A discussion to have with your interviewer is: who drives the pur- chasing decision for this key fob? Let’s assume that the parents are driving the decision, but the girl often offers input.

What do the parents need or care about? Price and safety are probably two of the biggest.

What does the girl care about? Appearance—she wants it to look good. Durability—she’s probably throwing it in her purse or backpack.

What else might the girl or the parents care about?

#### 4. What Features Will Meet These Needs?
Appearance: Offer the item in multiple colors with a glossy exterior, and have the key fold out from the key fob.

Durability: We want a durable material, like a hard plastic, that doesn’t scratch easily.

Safety: Can we implement a “911” button on the key fab? What about a global positioning system (GPS) tracker—or is this too scary? 

One other area to dig deeper into is the purchase process. Can someone “upgrade” to this type of key fab? To what extent should
we optimize for this scenario?

And -
- more accessible and usable
- user testing
